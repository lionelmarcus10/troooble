hints:
  steps:
    - step: 1
      title: "Check Service Accessibility"
      text: |
        Ensure both your frontend and backend services are accessible from the internet. Use tools like `curl` or `wget` to test connectivity and validate that the services respond as expected.
    - step: 2
      title: "Validate Local Connectivity"
      text: |
        Test local connectivity using `curl` or `wget` to validate service responses on localhost.
    - step: 3
      title: "Check Docker Container Status"
      text: |
        Verify that all Docker containers in your compose stack are running and healthy.
    - step: 4
      title: "Examine Frontend Dockerfile"
      text: |
        Review your frontend Dockerfile to confirm proper setup and successful builds.
    - step: 5
      title: "Review docker-compose.yml"
      text: |
        Check your docker-compose.yml syntax and service definitions for correctness.
    - step: 6
      title: "Check service local availability"
      text: |
        Does your docker-compose setup work correctly on your local machine ?
    - step: 7
      title: "Check API Forwarding"
      text: |
        - "Is your frontend correctly forwarding API requests to the backend service ?"
        - "Is firewalld blocking external access to required ports ?"
        - "Is only your frontend accessible from the internet while keeping internal services protected ?"
